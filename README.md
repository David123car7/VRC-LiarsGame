## How It Works?

The player interacts with the menu to enter the game. Once inside, they can choose their preferred side at the table by interacting with one of the four buttons. After selecting a button, its text will change from "Not Ready" to "Ready", indicating that the player is prepared to start. The game will only begin once all players are ready, with a minimum of two players and a maximum of four. The number of cards dealt will adjust dynamically based on the number of players in the game.

After the game starts, players can choose a card to play by interacting with their hand. To call out a bluff, players interact with the shuffled cards in the center of the table. When a bluff is called, the last played card is revealed. If the player who played the card was lying, they must interact with the revolver, facing a 50% chance of losing (being eliminated) or continuing to play. However, if the player was telling the truth, the one who called the bluff must interact with the revolver instead, risking elimination.

The game ends when a player successfully plays all their cards or is the last one standing. Itâ€™s important to note that every interaction in the game whether playing a card, calling a bluff, or interacting with the revolver is accompanied by its own unique animation and sound , adding to the immersive and thrilling atmosphere of the experience.
